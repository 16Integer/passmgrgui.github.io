# passmgrgui website

This is the basic download & contact page for the passmgrgui program at https://passmgrgui.github.io, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript.
As I hate google spying, I store the css & ttf Google Sans + Source Sans Pro files on this github repository, not being served from Gstatic.
